# Project Constitution

> Universal policies that apply to ALL code in this project.
> This file is always inherited from root - modules cannot override it.

## Git Workflow

- **Commit Style**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches merged via pull request
- **Main Branch**: `main` is always deployable

## Code Review

- All changes require pull request review
- At least one approval required before merge
- No self-merging to main/master
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review

## CI/CD

- All PRs must pass CI checks before merge
- Automated tests run on every push
- Main branch deployments are automated

## Security Policies

- **No secrets in code** - use environment variables or secret management
- Dependencies must be from trusted sources
- Security vulnerabilities addressed within SLA
- No credentials, API keys, or tokens in source control

## Documentation

- Public reducers/tables must be documented
- Breaking schema changes require migration notes
- `DESIGN/` and `.specs-fire/` artifacts must stay synchronized

## Project-Specific Policy

- `DESIGN/` is source of truth for this project.
- `BitCraftPublicDoc/` and `BitCraftPublic/BitCraftServer/` are reference only.
- When conflicts occur, project DESIGN and stated requirements override external references.
