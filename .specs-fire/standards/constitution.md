# Project Constitution

> Universal policies that apply to ALL code in this project.
> This file is always inherited from root — modules cannot override it.

## Git Workflow

- **Commit Style**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:)
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches merged via pull request
- **Main Branch**: main is always deployable

## Code Review

- All changes require pull request review
- At least one approval required before merge
- No self-merging to main/master
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review

## CI/CD

- All PRs must pass CI checks before merge
- Automated tests run on every push
- Main branch deployments are automated

## Security Policies

- **No secrets in code** — use environment variables or secret management
- Dependencies must be from trusted sources
- Security vulnerabilities addressed within SLA
- No credentials, API keys, or tokens in source control

## Documentation

- Public APIs must be documented
- Breaking changes require migration notes
- README kept up to date with setup instructions
